# Image-Vectorization-by-Triangulation

I'm trying to implement this [paper](https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2020/8871588.pdf). Personally I find it quite vague and I've been struggling at parts. For now this project is postponed until a new light emerges. I would truly appreciate anyone who could contribute or point out my mistake in this project of mine.
If you wish to contribute, feel free to ask any questions related to this project if you have some and I'll try to answer with what I know.
